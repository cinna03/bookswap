# BookSwap - Flutter Firebase App

A Flutter application for book swapping with real-time features using Firebase.

## Architecture

│   └── repositories/    # Data access layer
├── domain/
│   ├── entities/        # Business entities
│   └── usecases/        # Business logic
└── presentation/
    ├── screens/         # UI screens
    ├── widgets/         # Reusable widgets
